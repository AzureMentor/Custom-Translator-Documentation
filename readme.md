# Custom Translator Documentation

The Microsoft Custom Translator preview is feature of the Microsoft Translator service. With Custom Translator, enterprises, app developers and language service providers can build neural translation systems that understand the terminology used in their own business and industry. The customized translation system will then seamlessly integrate into existing applications, workflows and websites. 

Custom Translator allows users to customize Microsoft Translatorâ€™s advanced neural machine translation when translating text using the Microsoft Translator Text API (Version 3 only), and speech translation using the preview of Cognitive Services Speech.
