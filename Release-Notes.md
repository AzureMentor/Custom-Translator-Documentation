# Release notes

**25 October 18**
* **â€¢	Sharing your workspace:** You can now share your workspace with other users. Choose between read only, editor, or full access for each user. 
* **Multiple workspaces:** You can create multiple workspaces. This allows for better organization of projects and documents.  
* **Phrase dictionary:** You may now include phrase dictionaries in the training process. When you include a phrase dictionary in training your model, the phrases listed are translated in the way you specified. The dictionary also holds your Do-Not-Translate phrases. Letting the system learn from your training material in full sentences is generally a better choice than using a dictionary.
* **Sentence dictionary:** The sentence dictionary allows you to specify an exact target translation for a source sentence.
* **Sentence alignment:** Improvements to the sentence alignment process result in more sentences being aligned.  We encourage you to try retraining your systems to take advantage of the additional data that can be aligned now.
* **Chinese TMX files now support zh-CN abbreviation:** You no longer need to replace zh-CN with zh-Hans in Chinese TMX files.
* **Added new languages:** Serbian-Latin and Bosnian.
* UI changes and bug fixes.
